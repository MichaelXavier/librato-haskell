# Network.Librato
Librato API bindings for Haskell. Currently a work in process.

## Done so far
* most data types are modeled.
* Full REST interface and HTTP layer are mostly done.
* HTTP stubbed tests for some API calls

## TODO
* a few remaining trickier models need to be coded against
* full integration testing of all resources
* higher-level aggregation and queueing mechanisms
* cleanup of poorly factored low-level HTTP code
* travis-ci integration
* release
* get the library on the official librato dev page
